# "What Moves the Eyes: Doubling Mechanistic Model Performance Using Deep Networks to Discover and Test Cognitive Hypotheses"

## Or: "DeepGaze vs SceneWalk"

Here you can find project code for our NeurIPS 2025 paper "What Moves the Eyes: Doubling Mechanistic Model Performance Using Deep Networks to Discover and Test Cognitive Hypotheses", available at <https://openreview.net/forum?id=cnrwqlr8dg>.

Right now, the repository contains code for the SceneWalk-X model implemented in [Jax](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/).
The original numpy implementation, for reference, can be found [here](https://github.com/lschwetlick/SceneWalk_Model).

We are also working on releasing the code to reproduce the paper's experiments.
